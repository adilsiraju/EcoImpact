# Impact Calculator

A Python tool to predict environmental impacts (carbon reduced, energy saved, water conserved) based on investment amounts in various sustainability categories.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd impact_calculator
text
2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
text
3. Run the script:

python impact_calculator.py
text

## Usage

Run the script and input:
- Investment amount (in ₹)
- Category (e.g., "Renewable Energy", "Water Conservation")
- Technology (e.g., "Solar", "Manual")

Example:

Enter investment amount (₹): 15000
Enter category (e.g., 'Renewable Energy'): Renewable Energy
Enter technology (e.g., 'Solar'): Solar

Results for Renewable Energy:
Amount Invested: ₹15000.00
Carbon Reduced: 2000 kg
Energy Saved: 4000 kWh
Water Conserved: 0 L

- Recycling
- Emission Control
- Water Conservation
- Reforestation
- Sustainable Agriculture
- Clean Transportation
- Waste Management
- Green Technology
- Ocean Conservation

## Technologies
- Solar, Wind, Hydro, Organic, Mechanical, Chemical, Biofuel, EV, Manual, AI

## Notes

Step 5: Test It

    Save impact_calculator.py, requirements.txt, and README.md in your impact_calculator/ folder.
    Open a terminal in that folder:
    bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
python impact_calculator.py
Test with inputs like ₹15,000, "Renewable Energy", "Solar" to verify it works.
